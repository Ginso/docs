## About

This "library" makes develepoing many games(especially euro games) much simpler, as it provides structures for

- undo function (of single and all undoable actions)
- follow-up actions (actions that can trigger a variety of other actions)
- player actions in general
- many small helper functions

It is suited for games where the main part of the game has only one active player at a time.\
If you have already started devoleoping, it will of course be more difficult to integrate the library into your project, depending on how much you have already done. It might be easier to start a new project, include the library and keep your old code ready for copying various snippets.

If you have any questions, you can find me on BGA as [Ginso](https://boardgamearena.com/player?id=88401979)\
For questions about usages you can also check my nucleum implementation

## Download the code

Clone the repository from GitHub into your modules directory and name it "core":

```
git clone https://github.com/Ginso/BGA-Core.git modules/core
```

## Modify your project

There are a few changes you will have to make to the auto-generated files.\
You can either do them step by step or download the templates and replace the class and game names with your game. If you haven't started developing yet, i recommend the templates.

### Using the Templates

The templates are available here:\
// TODO

DO NOT replace the auto-generated files yet. Download them and save them somewhere.

In every js and php file adjust the comment at the top and in php files replace the namespace with the one from your generated Game.php

\
In **<u>Game.php</u>** also replace the line`return "mygame";` with the respective line from your generated Game.php

In **<u>X.js</u>** replace 'x' in the line `return declare("bgagame.x", [` with your game name as in the respective line from your generated js file

Once you edited all php and the js files you can replace the generated files with them

The files NotificationManager.php, Player.php and Stuff.php don't replace anything. Just put them into your modules directory. (You can create subfolders if you like, in wich case you need to change the import in the Game.php)\
All 3 have a counterpart in the library and they each extend the class defined in that counterpart. In this documentation i will refer to the files from the library as the core class and the ones from the template as the custom class. So, the custom class is a subclass of the core class and you will only edit the custom class

## Changing files from the library

If you really need to change files in the library, you can do it of course. But keep it mind that it could create conflicts if you ever update it to a new version.\
Instead consider contacting me and tell me why you want to change it.

## Accessing the Game instance

The Core class keeps the isntance of the Game class in the variable \$game, so you can access functions like notifyAllPlayers from everywhere like this:\
`Core::$game->notifyAllPlayers`
