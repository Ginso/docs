title: "Gameflow and Actions"
---

As you can see, the template for the states file contains 2 more states than the generated file.\
Usually i don't need any other states for the main part of the game. (Only for the setup, if player have to choose something)

After the setup is done (including player choices), make the first player active and go to

## ST_PLAYER_TURN

This is the main state where the game happens. Whenever you think, you need an extra state for an action, you probably can do it using virtual states(see [Playerturn frontend](/usage/playerturnJS)) and perhaps notifications

All the actions that a play can take during the main game can usually be put into these categories

- Base actions: like end turn, undo, wait, refillMarket
- Main actions: usuallay a player can or has to do a certain number of them
- Follow-up actions: actions that become available due to any effects triggered by another action
- Free actions: actions that can be done at any time or at certain points during the turn

the base actions need to be defined in the state, the rest are handled witch `actPlayerAction` , which of course also needs to be defined in the state(see [setup](/index))\
All the mentioned actions are already defined in the core library(and added to your game.php via the use statement during setup).\
The follow-up actions will be stored in the database with one entry for each action. There they all have their own id. So when i speak of the id of a follow-up action i'm NOT referring to the action type, but to the id of the db-entry. They are handled by the [Action ](/usage/utils)class

What you need to do:

- define [constants](/usage/constants) for each action. The main and free actions should have negative values, the follow-up actions positive(may start at 0). The names of the constants should start with ACTION\_\
  If a main action can also be a follow-up action you only need to define it once(with a negative value)
- if you implement `public function playerAction(mixed $args, int $actIdx)` in your game.php it will be called, whenever actPlayerAction is called. (again see [Playerturn frontend](/usage/playerturnJS)) \
  \$args will contain the array given to that action and \$actIdx will be the action if it is a follow-up or the action constant if it is a free or main action (that's why they have to be negative, so you can distinguish them here)\
  Here you can handle stuff like checking if the player really can do the action(not necessary for follow-up) or storing that a main action has been done...
- implement a function for each action in your custom Player class. The name of the function must conform to the name of the constant. For example if the constant is called ACTION_PLAY_CARD you need to implement `public function playCard` the first parameter will contain the arguments from the followup-action as stored in the db. for main and free actions it will always be null, the other parameters can be whatever you need for the action and have to be given by the front end (again see [Playerturn frontend](/usage/playerturnJS))\
  If the function returns **true, **the action will not be removed and no logs will be saved. Usefull if a decision has to be made first, (see virtual states in [playerturn frontend](/usage/playerturnJS))
- whenever a player receives a follow-up action call Action::addFollowUpAction

## The Action class

The class Action from the library handles the follow-up actions. \
Follow-up actions arde returned as arrays with the following entries:

- id(int): unique id for the database
- action(int): the type (constant) of the action
- args: arguments for the action, can be anything, but usually an array. is stored as json
- player(int): the player id of the player who got it

parent(int): null or the id of another follow-up action that triggered this action

### (static) functions of the Action class

- `getFollowUpActions(?int $pid=null, bool $currentLevelOnly = true)`\
  returns all possible actions for a player
  - \$pid: the player_id of the player. if null is given(default) the active player is assumed
  - \$currentLevelOnly: For this parameter you have to ask yourself the following:\
    Assume a player has multiple follow-up-actions and resolves one of them which gives him new follow-up-actions. Does he have to resolve them before doing any of the other follow-up action(because they "belong" to the follow-up action he just did) or can he do all follow-up actions in any order? If he has to do the new ones first use true(default) otherwise false
- `getFollowUpActionsOfType(int $type, ?int $pid=null)`\
  returns all followup actions of a given action. \$pid as above
- `getFollowUpActionTree(int $pid)` returns the actionTree as needed by the frontend. YOu probably won't need to call this
- `getFollowUpAction(int $id)`\
  returns the follow-up action with the given id
- `getFollowUpActionsPerPlayer()`\
  returns an assiocatives array with player_ids mapping to the possible actions of that player
- `otherPlayersHaveActions(int $pid)`\
  checks if any player other than \$pid have any follow-up actions
- `addFollowUpAction(int $action, array $args=[], int $origin=0, ?int $pid=null, int $amount=1, bool $notif=true)`\
  adds a follow-up-action
  - \$type: the action constant
  - \$args: arguments for the action
  - \$origin: origin of the action. See [notifiactions](/usage/notifications)
  - \$pid: id of the player to receive the action. null for active player
  - \$amount: how often
  - \$notif: if a notifcation should be send
- `removeFollowUpAction(int $id)`
- `resetFollowUpActions(?int $pid=null)`\
  removes all follow-up actions for a player
- `getActionName(int $action, bool $lowerCase=true)` \
  searches for a constant with the given value and starting with ACTION\_ and returning the name in camel-case\
  For example if the constant is named ACTION_PLAY_CARD, this will return 'playCard' (or 'PlayCard' if \$lowercase is false)

## Arguments for the state

The arguments for this state are calculated in the [Player](/usage/player) class. In your custom Player class implement the function `getActionArgsImpl` . It should return an array with the following entries

- "actions" =\> an array of all possible actions, each entry should contain:
  - "action" =\> the constant of that action
  - "args" =\> the arguments for that action
  - optional: "id" =\> for follow-up actions, this should contain the id from the db
  - optional: "free" =\> true, if it is a free action
  - optional: "available" =\> false, if the player currently can't perform it
- "main" =\> if the player can perform a main action
- "realActive" =\> true/false if the current active player is the one whos actual turn it is. Usually you can just use `Core::getGlobal("realActivePlayer") == 0`
- "canRefillMarket" =\> is you have some form of 'market' like  a card display, set this to true if it there are empty spaces that can be refilled (see [markets](/usage/markets))
- "canUndo" =\> if there are undoable actions use `Log::hasUndoableActions()`
- "canEndTurn" =\> if the 'end turn' button should be displayed
- "actionTree" =\> `Actions::getPossibleActionTree($pid)`
- "wait" =\> see below. Usually you can just use`Actions::otherPlayersHaveActions($pid)`

## Waiting for other players

In many games, situations may occur, where player have to take an action outside their turn, becuase the active player triggered something where they have to make a choice(like picking something). In this case the argument "wait" above should be true. If this player needs to take the action before the active one continues, also make sure, that the "actions" argument is an empty array. Then he can either undo or wait. When he clicks wait, the other player becomes active. We then have to distinguish between the active player(the one who can currently do something) and the REAL active player(the one whos turn it is and is waiting). While the real active player is waiting, his id is stored in the gamestatevalue "realActivePlayer". This variable however is normally 0 and only set when a player is waiting. With `Core::getRealActivePlayerId();` you can always get the real active player, whether he is the active one or not.\
When calculating the arguments above, make sure to check if the active player is the real active player, since for ex. usually a player can't do the free actions outside his turn.\
Of course, waiting for players will [finalize the current state](/usage/undo)

## End of the game

Most games end either at a certain points or when some condition is met. You can trigger `Core::toggleGameEnd(int $variant)` with one of the 5 ENDVARIANT\_ constants to trigger the end game either

- at the end of the current round,i.e. when the player with player_no 1 would be next. (ENDVARIANT_END_ROUND)
- at the end of the next Round (ENDVARIANT_END_ROUND_PLUS_ONE)
- after all OTHER players have one more turn (ENDVARIANT_ALL_OTHER_PLAYER)
- after all players including the current have one more turn (ENDVARIANT_ALL_PLAYER)
- immediately after this turn (ENDVARIANT_END_NOW)

They all work by setting a gamestatevalue to the number of turns(not rounds) remaining including the current one. Everytime stNextPlayer is called this value is decremented and if it would reach 0, the transition "end" the function `endGameScoring()` (defined in the template of Game.php) is called and then the transition "end" is used.\
Also note, that the first 2 methods use the player_no of the (real) active player

### Final Scoring

Most games have a final scoring. The library provides simple functions for that, which will display a dialog with a score table to all players and a notification per player.(Like in my games Revive and Nucleum) This is done inside the function `endGameScoring(?int $sendTo = null)`  in your Game.php\
When triggered by the end of the game, the parameter is always null.\
In some of my games(Revive for example, although it doesn't use this library) i allow Players to check how the score would look like at the current state(as far as they can know). In this case i call this function with the id of the requesting player and inside the function, if it is not null, i only use information visible to that player.\
If you don't want to add a functionality like that, ignore this parameter.\
If any hidden information should be revealed at the end of the game, send the necessary notifications in here.\
To use the library functions for scoring, you need to first call

```
$players = Player::getAllPlayers();
Core::startEndgameScoring($players);
```

Then you can do the actual scoring. For each row of the score table, you need to call `Core::score(string $title, array $players, callable $f, bool $update=true)`

- \$label: label for the start of the row (you need to call clienttranslate on it).
- \$players: as defined above
- \$f: a callable, that calaculates the score for a player
- \$update: if the score field of the player object should be increased by the calculated value(Will not be send to the DB)

Usually you want the callable to just return the calculated points. But in some cases you might want to display more(or something else) than just the value. \
In this case you can return an array with the first entry being the value to be added to \$player-score(if \$update=true) and the second, the text for the cell. Note, that this will not be translated, it is only intended to display terms like "32 (4 x 8)", (again, see Revive)

**Examples:**\
If the players can already receive points during the game, you should start with something like\
`Core::score(clienttranslate("VP so far"), $players, fn($player) => $player->score, false);`

```
$goal = Core::getGlobal("goal1");
$this->score(GeneralTexts::getTL("scoring2"), $players, function($player) use ($goal) {
	$p = $player->getFactor(1);
	$count = $player->scoreGoal($goal);
	$vp = $p*$count;
	return [$vp, "$vp ($p x $count)"];
});
```

Also don't forget to calculate the tie breakers. If you want to display them, you can also use that function, but with \$update=false and updating player_score_aux in the DB during the function yourself

At the end, complete the scoring with `Core::finishEndGameScoring($sendTo);` \
This will send the notifications and update the scores on the DB
