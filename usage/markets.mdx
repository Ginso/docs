title: "Markets"
---

Most Euro Games have some form of market, like a card display or something else that is refilled whenever someone takes something out of it. Either immediately or at the end of the turn.

If per rules it would happen immediately, but reveal hidden information, i let the player trigger it whenever he wants, because this will [finalize ](/usage/undo)the state. If he doesn't trigger it, the end of the turn(or waiting) will.

If you have a market like that you should implement the function refillMarket in your Game.php\
The player can trigger it, if the respective argument is true(see [Gameflow and Actions](/usage/states))
