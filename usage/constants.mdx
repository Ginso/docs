Like most games i use constants for better overview. Many of the constants are needed on both backend and frontend side. But instead of defining them twice i just send all my constants to the frontend. You should at least add your ACTION\_ (see [states](/usage/states)) and LOG\_(see [undo](/usage/undo)) constants to those.

Doing that is pretty simple. Just implement `public function getCustomConstants()`  in your game.php (already present in the template) and make it return an array like:

```
public function getCustomConstants() {
	return [
		[ACTION_PLAY_CARD, -1],
		// ...
		[LOG_PLAY_CARD, 10]
	];
}
```

in the frontend you can then access them using this.ACTION_PLAY_CARD

For bigger games you'll probably need a lot of constants, so i recommend creating a class like

```
<?php
namespace Bga\Games\Nucleum;
class CustomConstants {
	public static function getConstants() {
		return [
			['ACTION_PLAY_TILE',-1],

			['LOG_PLAY_TILE',10],
		];
	}
}

?>
```

and in the game.php

```
public function getCustomConstants() {
	return CustomConstants::getConstants();
}
```
