title: "Undo"
description: "This library makes it very easy to provide an undo function. Here the user can press 'undo' to undo the last action or 'undo all' to undo all undoable actions"

## Logs

In order to undo actions you need to log every change. Each action can generate multiple log entries.\
You'll have to define different log types, and for each log type, how to undo this (on backend and on frontend).\
When the player hits undo or undo all, the log entries will be handled one after another in reverse order.\
During the player action you can add a log entry with `Core::addLog([$type,$arg1,$arg2...])` \
The actPlayerAction automatically saves them. If you define any other actions that should create an entry, you should initialize the logs with `Core::$logData = [];` and at the end save them with\
`Log::addLog(Core::$logData);`\
Each log entry is a simple array with the first entry being the log type. I stringly advice defining constants for them. The library already has 6 types defined, so best start with 10 (leaving room for updates). The remaining entries depend on the log type. To keep an overview i recommend a comment behind every constant where you state, what the remaining entries should be.\
The predefined types are:

- LOG_ADD_ACTION and LOG_REMOVE_ACTION: Used by the Action class.\
  Check their usages if you think you need to use them
- LOG_SET_GLOBAL: used when you call Core::setGlobal or Core::getGlobal.\
  Check the usage if you think you need to use them
- LOG_GAME_END: used when you trigger Core::toggleGameEnd()
- LOG_MOVE_STUFF: If you use the Stuff table, you can use this whenever location and/or location_arg of an entry is changed. It requires the follwing arguments:
  1. id of the entry
  2. new location
  3. new location_arg
  4. type
- LOG_ADD_STUFF: If you use the Stuff table, you can use this whenever new stuff is added during the game. It requires the id and type of the element

For the backend undoing these predefined types is already implemented. For the frontend you only need to implement the last 2 (if you use them)

## Undoing your logs

### backend

The template of your Game.php comes with the function `undoAction`\
It is called for every log entry when it should be undone. The first argument is the log entry.\
it also gives you an associative array of all players (id =\> player, see [Player class](/usage/player)) and the id of the player undoing the action

### frontend

Quite similar the template for your js file comes also with the function `undoAction`\
Since all come with one notification, i stringly recommend to avoid animations here
