## Notifications

The X.js template comes with the function setupNotifications already filled with the predefined notifications. Here you can just add your own. They duration of them are all multiples of this.animDuration, which is used in animation functions of this library. If you use them, you just need to add the number of animations in here.\
For each of your notifications you need to define the function notif\_\<name\> (ex. `notif_playCard: function(args){}`)
