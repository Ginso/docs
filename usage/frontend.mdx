## Notifications

The X.js template comes with the function setupNotifications already filled with the predefined notifications. Here you can just add your own. They duration of them are all multiples of this.animDuration, which is used in animation functions of this library. If you use them, you just need to add the number of animations in here.\
For each of your notifications you need to define the function notif_NAME (ex. `notif_playCard: function(args){}`)

## Useful functions

The library also provides many helpfull functions that all be called using this.functionName()

- `takeAction(action, args = {}, lock=true)` \
  calls bgaPerformAction with the args. if not present it adds 'act' before the action name and uppercases the first letter. if the 3rd parameter is false, it uses {lock:false, checkAction:false}\
  If an exception is thrown, it calls onLeavingState and shortly afterwards onEnteringState
- `addTooltipImageAndText: function(id, image, text, col=true)`
